        <p>Did more of the same this week study wise. Moved onto the third lecture on
           CS50, and that went alright. A bit trickier, but still feeling good to get
           through the lecture and test out the various concepts that we learn on the
           given problems. Don't think there was anything in particular that stood out,
           just more C.
        </p>
        <p>I also tried pushing through the Odin Project stuff some more and made quite
           a dent in that. Have moved passed all the initial stages as well as the initial
           delving into HTML, and I think I'm at the CSS parts now. There was a whole
           page on flexbox which was good to try out since I never really played with
           that before properly.
        </p>
        <p>I also made a separate site using the flexbox stuff for the inktober posts that
           I'm going to be doing. Though I did run out of time these last few days on
           finishing that off properly, so I need to do that. I want to add a story page
           for each piece and I don't want to have to make a secondary site so that things
           look good on mobile. I want it to really work across both. I'll finish that
           off tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>This week I started both the part time job as well as Inktober. Both are going
           to take a fair bit of time on a regular basis, but I think it'll be good to
           help me get back into regular art making.
        </p>
        <p>I do feel like I was more distracted this week away from studying than last
           week, but I have nothing extra coming up this week until the weekend so I
           should be able to get back into the higher gear. I'd like to be able to
           finish off the inktober website, complete another lecture on CS50, and make
           a further dent on the Odin Project.

        <p>Week one, completed. It's felt great.</p>
        <p>But anyway, I've started with the CS50 course that Harvard offer for free,
           (as long as you don't buy into the certificate); as well as pushing through
           with the Odin Project foundation. CS50 has started me off with C as well
           as general Computer Science, and the Odin project is HTML/CSS focussed
           so far. The C stuff is interesting, kinda like javascript on the outset,
           but the end of lecture challenges have been really good and interesting.
           I managed okay with the first few but one of them really stumped me and I
           ended up googling the answer. I was a bit bummed, but after seeing the answer
           I definitely made the right choice.. I was not going to guess my way into
           that this early on. There are 9 "weeks" left on the CS50, but I know that
           some of them cover areas of computer science that I already know pretty
           well so I will be aiming to finish that off quicker. Either way it'll be
           done before the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>The Odin Project so far is just covering areas I already know, but it's
           still been useful since I never really learned this stuff properly. I only
           ever covered the networking side of the CIW course I did many years ago,
           pretty much everything I know about html/css was self taught, so there are
           gaps. Also there are things that weren't around back then like flexbox, and
           although I know what it is and how it works it's still useful to get to
           grips with it and practice it. I'll get though the html/css quickly and
           then it moves onto javascript which will be the more interesting part.
        </p>
        <p>Something else I've picked up again this week was going through some maths
           courses on Khan Academy. I started doing this a few months ago but dropped
           it because I aimed too low.. It's good practice though. I've gone through
           a bunch of arithmetic practice and now doing fractions/decimals. It's all
           coming back nice and easy, it's just good I think to get used to dealing
           with numbers often again. It'll definitely help with the javascript/C stuff.
        </p>
        <p>The other thing I've been getting into the daily habit of doing is practicing
           getting my typing speed up and stable on some typing test site. It's been a
           good thing to do first thing in the morning before I get going.
        </p>
        <p>This coming week will be more of the same, but I also want to be starting to
           spend time buildin up a separate project and the first one I want to work on
           is this site. At the moment I'm hard coding these weekly entries, and I'd like
           to build something where I can login and put in an entry, and maybe add
           some more features along the way as I pick things up.
        </p>
        <p>Part time job starts tomorrow, 1-4. Means 3 hours less time to study but
           also means not burning through savings for the next 6 months as long as I
           remain sensible... we'll see how that one goes.

        <p>Alright, first entry. Technically I’m starting this journey from tomorrow,
           so this weekend has been more about mentally preparing, as well as making
           sure physical space is clean and food is prepped so that tomorrow can be
           full focus.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve got a few ideas in mind about where to start, and I’m not exactly
           sure how it’s going to go. I think that I’m going to explore a bit the
           various resources and then make a timetable as the day goes on to map
           out how much time different things get. I’ve used the ODIN project before,
           and I’m currently signed up to the Harvard CS50 course. I’ve done the first
           lesson of it and it’s pretty decent, but I don’t want to sit around watching
           videos all week, so I’ll probably do some of that as well as play with
           other things.
        </p>
        <p>I’m doing all of this on an ElementaryOS flavoured VM that I’ve set up
           purely for this purpose. Nothing wrong with Windows for me, but it made
           sense to set something Linux based up so that I can practice using it
           again.
        </p>
        <p>Main goals for this week then are to get going, have some idea about
           which resources to focus on at first, and maybe even have a rough timetable
           in mind for the days. Also to spend the week using Linux, and make sure
           that I’m not just reading/watching things, but also trying to build something,
           even if it’s simple.
