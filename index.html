        <p>Well, we did not get quite as far as we'd hope, but that's fine. It is
          what it is. We spent a few days going over our notes and also going over
          the notes in the lecture writeup and comparing and adjusting. Definitely
          happy with that side of things, and it made me feel more ready to take on
          the lab challenge. I did not, however, get to complete it. To be fair to
          myself, I did not have the full 3 sessions/days to work at it, as there
          was quite a lot of other stuff going on. We'll definitely do it this
          week.</p>

        <p>We did, though, finish the last days of the Linux skillupchallenge which
          was great to do. It really felt useful right up until the end, and I'd like
          to think that this week I'll continue to go back into the webserver and
          plan what to do with it properly, whilst also researching the prices of
          the service that I picked. Perhaps I could even take a look at AWS and
          whatever else is recommended by the course to see if there is a better
          one. As long as it's not crazy expensive, I think I'd like to move my two
          websites over to that. That'll be one move off the provided service and
          then hopefully as I delve deeper into the js/php side of things after CS50,
          I'll be able to move off of Shopify also.</p>

        <p>This week though, is focusing back on the CS50 lab and then the problem
          so that at the very least I am ready to be moving onto Lecture6 at the
          beginning of next week.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
         <small>23-01-22</small>
          <p>So another week gone by, and we've finished watching the lecture for
            Week 5 on CS50, which was surrounding data structures and different ways
            to create "linked lists". It was very interesting and I definitely made
            a bigger effort on the note taking which I'm hoping will pay off. We're
            going to go in hard this week on finishing the problems. There's only
            1 lab and 1 problem this time, so hopefully it won't take too long to
            do. I'm also going to re go over the notes and make them better, re-reading
            if necessary the notes on the website.</p>

          <p>This week has also been 5 more days of the Linux skill up challenge,
            which has been great to get back into. Introducing some things I already
            knew, but giving more depth to them. The resources given are all really
            interesting, and I think it'd be good even, later in the year to do
            it again and see what new resources are added and also see which things
            I use more myself and how I can commit some of those commands to memory.
            In general, since I've been using a lot of Linux, I think a lot of it
            has come back to me already.</p>

          <p>We've still not touched back in with ODIN, but perhaps when I've finished
            Januarys skill up challange with Linux, it'd be a good thing to get back
            into. Perhaps with a focus on using my webserver for my own purposes
            and seeing what I can do to host my websites myself rather than rely
            on one.com.</p>

          <p>We'll see about that though. This coming week is focusing on more Linux
            learning and finishing off Week 5, whilst also hopefully getting into
            the Week 6 lecture. This has all taken a lot longer than I thought it
            would, but that's fine we're getting through it the best we can.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_container">
        <small>09-01-22</small>
        <p>Well, it's the new year! Time flew by it seems and I'm already at the
          end of the first week of 2022. This week I decided to jump into the Linux
          Skill Up Challenge over on reddit,
          (https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/). Saw this around the
          end of November and decided that December wasn't the month to start it,
          but January would be. It's been really good so far, I've set up a remot
          webserver with Digital Ocean for 5$ and gone through the first week of
          very basic learning of commands. It's all rehashing of things I already
          feel pretty comfortable with, but there were a few good tips in there,
          so I'm enjoying having that to do in the evenings, alongside some maths
          and typing practice.</p>

       <p>I've also jumped back into CS50, feeling better about the things that I
         wasn't so sure about at the end of last year. Finished off lesson 4 and we're
         going to be going into lesson 5 later today. Something I was thinking about
         a lot last week is that I spent a lot of time during lesson 4 going back
         over things way too many times, and I think that's partly because I've been
         getting worse at note taking as the weeks have gone by during the first
         watch of the lecture.</p>

       <p>So this week I'm going to be taking more time on the video, pausing it as
         necessary to make the best possible notes. This way I think I'll get more
         comfortabel with the material and probably have to spend less time working
         things out when I'm doing the problems.</p>

       <p>Something else I've been thinking about lately is what to do when I finish
         CS50. I am going to be doing the ODIN project more of course, and concentrating
         on javascript. But I thought it'd be a fun project to go back to the CS50
         problems and solve them using javascript. Then also creating some webpages
         to present the solutions in a website. They are ready made problems after
         all, and this would let me flex the html/css as well as have something to
         play with using javascript. We'll see how that one goes..</p>

       <p>Anyway, that's that for now! Hopefull should be talking about how I completed
         Lesson 5 in the next one!</p>

        <p>Alright! It's the holiday season coming up so we're mostly going to be
          taking a break from all of this. I think I'l be very tempted to keep looking
          at it here and there and I'm certainly not going to be stopping myself,
          but we're also not going to pressure ourselves into feeling like we need
          to do that.</p>
        <p>I've got those two books that I could read also, as a half leisure, half
          learning thing to be doing. It'll be helpful without straining too much
          over the holiday break. I think I'll aim to do the next one of these on
          the 9th Jan. I could do the 2nd but I won't really have anything to talk
          about studywise, so till Next Year!</p>

      <div class="text_container">

        <p>Holy Crapola. I don't actually say that. I finished the problem from before
          and it took way longer than it should have. Though I a quite glad that it's
          done and I've moved onto the "recover" problem. This one is more about
          file manipulation with some conditional statments there in to manipulate
          data and create files... easy. Right?</p>
        <p>I've also actually started watching the video for the next week which has
          been good to do. It's felt good just to start watching and taking the notes
          nd feels a bit more like we're back on track with how things are meant to
          be going. Apart from that Xmas is coming up, so I am thinking about when
          to take the break.. Will think on that a bit more before making a decision.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>21-11-21</small>
        <p>Another week has gone by, and this one I did make some actualy progress
          with Week 6, Lecture 5.</p>
        <p>The difficulty has been of pointers and the associated lab problem. It's
          been tricky to get my head around, but I'm definitely also been procrastinating,
          probably because I was finding things a bit difficult. The problem was to take a
          BMP file and create a little program that can either make a new image from
          the original, but greyscale, another that creates a sepia image, another
          that creates a mirror image, and finally one that blurs the image.</p>
        <p>This last week I managed to create the part of the program that turns the
          image grey and sepia, and now I'm thinking about the mirrored image. Essentially
          it's about going through each pixel one at a time and then reversing each
          row of them. The first two problems did not actually require pointers at
          all, which threw me. I figured I'd definitely need to be using them, but
          when I solved it and realised they didn't actually need them at all, I
          had to look at it differently.</p>
        <p>Mirroring will require pointers. I've been reading/watching the notes and
          lectures again though to make sure I get it..</p>
        <p>This coming week I really need to have finished that problem and there's
          still one more from this lecture after. My goal of finishing this course
          before xmas seems unlikely now, but we'll see how the lectures after go.
          I might speed through a few of them if this is meant to be the hardest
          concept to grasp? We'll see.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
          <small>14-11-21</small>
          <p>Another week has gone by and this time I've made no progress on CS50,
            nor really on TOP. I did some flexbox work and I read over some of the notes
            from the CS50 one, but I really hit a wall on that. One which I intend
            to smash through this coming week.</p>

         <p>I did, however, get back into the regular Maths studying. I've also noticed
            a real different from doing the daily typing tests on keybr. It's been a
            little over a month now of regular practice and I can feel the speed is
            up and my accuracy on punctuation is better than before. Speed on the
            letters/numbers is harder to tell but probably also better.</p>

         <p>Not really learning/coding related, but I've reconfigured my Ubuntu VM to
            work with the i3 window manager and configured that to my liking. Works
            nicely with the two monitors and feels good for studying. Definitely feels
            good to have a separate environment for this side of things against everything
            else.</p>

         <p>This coming week, smashing through CS50, as well as the HTML side of TOP.
           Once I get through the wall happening with pointers the rest should come easy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_container">
        <small>8-11-21</small>
        <p>This last week has been a bit of a blur. I worked on the module that deals
          with file pointers and such, and I really find it quite confusing. I think
          I can grasp all of the concepts separately, but then working with them,
          I get lost quite easily. As mentioned before though, this is apparently the
          most difficult concept to grasp, so I'm giving myself time to absorb and
          doing the problems to help and I'll probably see what other reading I can
          do on the subject that will help. Always helps to hear things explained
          in more than one way.</p>

        <p>Apart from that I recaught up with TOP so I can work my way through something
          a bit easier but also remind myself of some things.. That was fine.</p>

        <p>Not much else to tell apart from that! These coming weeks I have a lot less
          planned socially, so I'm going to really try and get my head down and focus
          on studying.</p>

        <p>Till next week.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>31-10-21</small>
        <p>Alrighty, I managed to miss last week's entry, that's not so good is it.
          Anyway, onto this week, it was really a week of being back properly and not
          having to catch up with things, so I got through a fair chunk of CS50.
          Finished off Weed 3 (0 indexed) and started Week 4. Week 4 introduced the
          idea of pointers and file manipulation, which made some past things click
          and reveals the use of some training wheels with regards to string manipulation.</p>
       <p>I found it quite complicated and difficult actually, but David whatshisface in the
          videos says that's likely to be so, so I wasn't overly worried about it. I watched the
          extra videos as well, which do add up altogether but it felt worth it this week.
          I managed to complete the lab where you edit the sound volume of a wav file,
          which was mostly given to you but still good.</p>

       <p>I havn't worked at all on TOP these last few weeks as I've been concentrating
          so much on Inktober as well as studying. Today is the end of the month so that's
          all finished now which feels great. Also it means I can concentrate more
          on studying again, and putting some time into TOP and also putting a bit
          of extra time in the maths side of the Khan Academy, because that's been a
          bit neglected this month also.</p>

       <p>This coming week I'd like to finish the Labs for Week 4, and get a start on
          Week 5 of CS50. I've noticed that there are new recordings going up from this
          year which is interesting.. I might take a look at some of them, or at least
          the notes after I've finished CS50 2020, to see if there are any differences.
          I'm also going to concentrate as mentioned above on TOP, and hopefully get
          myself past the HTML/CSS stuff, (though I don't want to rush them in case they
          have useful tidbits I don't already know) and get to the javascript and beyond
          sections.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="text_container">
        <small>17-10-21</small>
        <p>This week I have been sick as a dog... started last Sunday night and for
          most of the week I have been completely useless to the world. I did a little
          reading from the Pragmatic Programmer, but really not enough to be noteworthy
          and that's the extent of my progress this week.</p>

        <p>But that's fine. Feeling a lot better tonight and tomorrow we begin again
          properly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>10-10-21</small>
        <p>Another week down
        </p>
        <p>This week was mainly concentrating on working up the Odin Project stuff
          as well as prettying the website for the Inktober stuff. Got that down well,
          and happy with it for something nice and simple. The Flexbox stuff made it
          easy for the site to work well on desktop & mobile without having to create
          a separate site like with my regular works, which is nice.
        </p>
        <p>I also made a bit more progress with CS50, though less so than other weeks.
          I had to finish off last week's Problems/Labs, and then only watched this weeks
          lecture on Thursday/Friday. It was mainly focussed on sorting algorithms,
          so there wasn't too much more code added to it. I'll have to try and tackle
          the problems from tomorrow and we'll see how that goes for the rest of
          the week.
        </p>
        <p>Part time job plodded along easily this week, and hopefully that will be
          the same from now on. It'll just happen for 3 hours a day and that'll be
          that.
        </p>
        <p>Less programming/study related but a lot of my time after the job was dedicated
          to inktober as it will be this coming week. Enjoying doing that again but
          I'm also kind of looking forward to doing a bit less of it come November,
          and maybe not feeling like I have to keep catching myself up for anything
          missed.
        </p>
        <p>Next week going to focus on CS50, and more of the Odin Project. I did start
          reading the Pragmatic Programmer a few weeks ago, and that's something else
          I've let slip so I'd like to pick that up again more heavily.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>03-10-21</small>
        <p>Did more of the same this week study wise. Moved onto the third lecture on
           CS50, and that went alright. A bit trickier, but still feeling good to get
           through the lecture and test out the various concepts that we learn on the
           given problems. Don't think there was anything in particular that stood out,
           just more C.
        </p>
        <p>I also tried pushing through the Odin Project stuff some more and made quite
           a dent in that. Have moved passed all the initial stages as well as the initial
           delving into HTML, and I think I'm at the CSS parts now. There was a whole
           page on flexbox which was good to try out since I never really played with
           that before properly.
        </p>
        <p>I also made a separate site using the flexbox stuff for the inktober posts that
           I'm going to be doing. Though I did run out of time these last few days on
           finishing that off properly, so I need to do that. I want to add a story page
           for each piece and I don't want to have to make a secondary site so that things
           look good on mobile. I want it to really work across both. I'll finish that
           off tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>This week I started both the part time job as well as Inktober. Both are going
           to take a fair bit of time on a regular basis, but I think it'll be good to
           help me get back into regular art making.
        </p>
        <p>I do feel like I was more distracted this week away from studying than last
           week, but I have nothing extra coming up this week until the weekend so I
           should be able to get back into the higher gear. I'd like to be able to
           finish off the inktober website, complete another lecture on CS50, and make
           a further dent on the Odin Project.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>26-09-21</small>
        <p>Week one, completed. It's felt great.</p>
        <p>But anyway, I've started with the CS50 course that Harvard offer for free,
           (as long as you don't buy into the certificate); as well as pushing through
           with the Odin Project foundation. CS50 has started me off with C as well
           as general Computer Science, and the Odin project is HTML/CSS focussed
           so far. The C stuff is interesting, kinda like javascript on the outset,
           but the end of lecture challenges have been really good and interesting.
           I managed okay with the first few but one of them really stumped me and I
           ended up googling the answer. I was a bit bummed, but after seeing the answer
           I definitely made the right choice.. I was not going to guess my way into
           that this early on. There are 9 "weeks" left on the CS50, but I know that
           some of them cover areas of computer science that I already know pretty
           well so I will be aiming to finish that off quicker. Either way it'll be
           done before the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>The Odin Project so far is just covering areas I already know, but it's
           still been useful since I never really learned this stuff properly. I only
           ever covered the networking side of the CIW course I did many years ago,
           pretty much everything I know about html/css was self taught, so there are
           gaps. Also there are things that weren't around back then like flexbox, and
           although I know what it is and how it works it's still useful to get to
           grips with it and practice it. I'll get though the html/css quickly and
           then it moves onto javascript which will be the more interesting part.
        </p>
        <p>Something else I've picked up again this week was going through some maths
           courses on Khan Academy. I started doing this a few months ago but dropped
           it because I aimed too low.. It's good practice though. I've gone through
           a bunch of arithmetic practice and now doing fractions/decimals. It's all
           coming back nice and easy, it's just good I think to get used to dealing
           with numbers often again. It'll definitely help with the javascript/C stuff.
        </p>
        <p>The other thing I've been getting into the daily habit of doing is practicing
           getting my typing speed up and stable on some typing test site. It's been a
           good thing to do first thing in the morning before I get going.
        </p>
        <p>This coming week will be more of the same, but I also want to be starting to
           spend time buildin up a separate project and the first one I want to work on
           is this site. At the moment I'm hard coding these weekly entries, and I'd like
           to build something where I can login and put in an entry, and maybe add
           some more features along the way as I pick things up.
        </p>
        <p>Part time job starts tomorrow, 1-4. Means 3 hours less time to study but
           also means not burning through savings for the next 6 months as long as I
           remain sensible... we'll see how that one goes.

        <p>Alright, first entry. Technically I’m starting this journey from tomorrow,
           so this weekend has been more about mentally preparing, as well as making
           sure physical space is clean and food is prepped so that tomorrow can be
           full focus.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve got a few ideas in mind about where to start, and I’m not exactly
           sure how it’s going to go. I think that I’m going to explore a bit the
           various resources and then make a timetable as the day goes on to map
           out how much time different things get. I’ve used the ODIN project before,
           and I’m currently signed up to the Harvard CS50 course. I’ve done the first
           lesson of it and it’s pretty decent, but I don’t want to sit around watching
           videos all week, so I’ll probably do some of that as well as play with
           other things.
        </p>
        <p>I’m doing all of this on an ElementaryOS flavoured VM that I’ve set up
           purely for this purpose. Nothing wrong with Windows for me, but it made
           sense to set something Linux based up so that I can practice using it
           again.
        </p>
        <p>Main goals for this week then are to get going, have some idea about
           which resources to focus on at first, and maybe even have a rough timetable
           in mind for the days. Also to spend the week using Linux, and make sure
           that I’m not just reading/watching things, but also trying to build something,
           even if it’s simple.
