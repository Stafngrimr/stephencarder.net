				<p>Been a few weeks since I made an entry so this might be a long one. Havn't yet finished the new version of the journal site. It's been a week or so since I looked at it actually, but just taking a look at it now, the database is done and linked. I've also played with the layout somewhat, though it's not quite ready for mobile. I've got the front page displaying the last 3 entries in the db, and that works nicely. I've got the login/updates set up, but I need to get the entry making part of the back end working. I also need to work out how to create new lines, and separate paragraphs nicely updating into the db but then also displaying on the main page.</p>

				<p>Basically the bulk of what needs doing is there, but ther are lots of niggly things that need to be worked out. I started doing TOP most days in the last few weeks which takes up some time, and then I briefly also started doing CS50 again to have some C work going even if it's just a little bit per week.</p>

				<p>I created a new layout with TOP which was good to do. Great practice for flex and layout designs in general, and quite fun to put together really. CSS can be a pain in the arse, but I'm working it out more and more as I go on of course.</p>

				<p>I also created the new temporary stafngrimr.com, which took me about a day. I've got it running on the digital ocean server already, I just need to look about changing over the domain name again, which I havn't done for many years so will require a bit more reading.</p>

				<p>With all the little things being added to making the site and doing the TOP course, I realised that I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. Lots of little jobs going on at once, and I felt like I wasn't giving any time to linked in, upwork or the first contributions website that I found. First contributions is about helping with open source projects on Github, breaking the first one open and just getting into the habit of doing so. I figured this would be great practice for how to git, since I use it often but only ever interacting with my own contributions and projects.</p>

				<p>Going to be looking at setting up either a Miro or something similar to help with organising all the various parts of what I'm doing. Folders and notes are great but maybe something bigger and better.. I do have an actualy whiteboard downstairs. Maybe that's the solution? Would be cool to have a white board in the room that could then print off from behind the image of what you've done on that day and save each days version via Github or something similar. Kinda like those remarkable notepads that allow you to create pdfs on whitepaper screens. Cool stuff.</p>

				<p>Anyway, lots going on. Will hopefully have the journal site done before the upcoming holiday on the 15the June!

        <small>24-04-22</small>
        <p>First week without the structured course and it's been good I think. It's
          felt a bit slow in parts, but I think that's inevitable as there is some
          reaching out of comfort zones and reading documentation on your own to figure
          things out.</p>

        <p>I decided to start with revamping this journal site and to get that going. As
          I think I mentioned last week I want to have it so that I'm not hard coding
          these journal entries into the html, but rather creating a unique login that
          takes me to a page to make a new update. I think the best way to do this
          involves having a small database for the journal entries, so for that I was
          looking into SQLAlchemy, which was the first part of new documentation to
          go through. It works differently to CS50s database connectivity code, but
          what I want to do is quite simple so I've just about got it down I think.</p>

        <p>I also had to install flask and all it's recommended dependencies, as well
          as learning about virtual environments and their importance, which went
          fine and I've got it all up and running. I want to read into things like
          Flask and Jinja a bit more, to see what else I can do with them and make
          the most of it. I figured this is the first framework I'm learning so I
          best dive deep to see how these things operate and what can be done with
          them.</p>

        <p>I've also decided to use Bulma as a CSS framework, to try something different
          from bootstrap. Since this is something a lot simpler, I might do some
          research to try a completely different one for the art shop, but we'll
          see about that when I get to it.</p>

        <p>I don't think this will take me too much longer to put together, but I wanna
          do it properly and also get it working on my own virtual server. I'm going
          to just do this site for now and then move onto something else before I
          do the art shop, mainly so I can have it up for a month, see how easy/cheap
          it is to do it through Digital Ocean and spend some time doing some research
          on other options.</p>

        <p>During that time I wanna go through TOP, and I was also considering regoing
          through CS50, as the course material I did was for last year and it'd be
          interesting to just go through the problems again one by one and see how
          quickly I can do them again from scratch. I think since conceptually I already
          know how to solve each one it'll be more about reinforcing some C code into
          my brain.</p>

        <p>Then when that's done I can finish the C-Game and do the Final Project!
          Till next time.</p>
      </div>

				<small>18-04-22</small>
				<p>So, we missed a week, but that's fine. There's a lot more to talk about
					this week than there was last week. I've finished the CS50 course, apart
					from the final project, but I'm going to concentrate on something else
					before jumping into the "final project."</p>

				<p>I finished the Flask tasks, which were a lot of fun. The Birthdays application
					was a good easy one to start with and then there was the implementation of
					a webapp that allowed you to buy/sell stocks, checking the prices via an
					IEX.com API and also have a database where users had their information/stocks
					saved. It took all of last week but each piece was easier than the last
					as I was understanding more and more of how all the pieces fit together.
					It also gave good practice for things like sql and jinja. I'm definitely
					going to see if I can use something similar to make my websites now so that
					I can make them more dynamic, and that's why I'm not going to be jumping
					straight into the final project.</p>

				<p>I'd like the final project to be something totally different. Something
					like a game, or a mobile app. Something that will require reading the documentation
					for a language I've not really delved into before and it might make it
					harder but that's half the point. The other reason being that in a month
					or two my annual sub for one.com is open and I don't want to renew it. I
					want to have this site and my other site on my own servers, and ideally
					completely redone using all the new knowledge. I'll build my own shop that
					links with creativehub/printful for my artist stuff, and I'd like the journal
					to have it's own database where all the entries are saved so that I can
					show them/add to them and search through them dynamically through the website.
					(At the moment these are all being hardcoded into the site via my IDE).</p>

				<p>So apart from finishing the Flask app, there was also the last lecture
					to watch which was something of a recap/conclusion but also included an
					interesting talk on the ethics of sharing information and web/software design.
					Definitely a topical and interesting discussion that I saved for today and
					went through at a leisurely pace.</p>

				<p>Next steps then are to start desigining mentally/on paper and in whatever
					other way the websites. I think I'll start with this one as I suspect it'll
					be the easier one to do. It'll also involve playing with the virtual server
					I have with digital ocean so that'll be something of a learning experience also.</p>
			</div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>03-04-22</small>
        <p>This has been a busy week in more ways than just the studying but I've
					managed to get a few things finished which felt good. Firstly, we finished
					the first Flask lab which was to make the trivia site. There was an option
					to play with the CSS but I wasn't interested in that; I mainly wanted to
					make sure I understood how the framework worked and get it all working
					together. It ended up being very simple though, so I finished that off
					quite quickly.</p>

        <p>Then I went back and refocused on the "Homepage" that was left somewhat
					unfinished from the previous lecture. In the end I made a homepage for
					Anne Boleyn rather than myself because I've done a few sites for myself
					over the years and really it was more interesting to do one about Anne.
					I was quite happy with what I added and spent a whole day reworking the
					CSS to fit what I had intended and then adding more javascript to change
					parts of the site.</p>

        <p>The javascript I ended up using was pretty simple, and though what it
					did to the site was really cool it wasn't overly complicated to put together.
					I was still happy that it all worked and felt like I understood what had
					been shown.</p>

        <p>I was however, a bit stumped on the CSS, the flexboxes specifically, not
					doing what I ended up wanting them to do for a while. I stopped and did
					a little doodle of what I wanted and planned out the flex boxes on paper
					and then basically removed most if not all of that code and redid it according
					to the new plan. Definitely something to take away was the idea that you
					should stop and replan flexboxes/grids once they start to really become
					complicated. All the lower levels boxes containing the content of each
					page itself were fine, it was just making them sit on the page in the right
					way, so I only had to manipulate those high levels ones.</p>

        <p>All in all, it was good to spend the extra time on the website design
					and javascript, as that's the bit that I should be concentrating on.</p>

					with session logins, updates using APIs from IEX and higher level javascript
					so that'll be good! We'll tackle that from tomorrow as the focus. Also
					setting myself at least an hour a day to go through upwork and find some
					freelance jobs! That parts a bit concerning, but gotta jump in and start
					getting it done.</p>

        <p>I've been looking back at the C-game. It's been ages since I looked at
					it or even thought in C but I do think it'd be good to push doing that and
					getting it finiished. Whilst I don't intend to go down that route, it will
					be good practice and I don't want to be leaving projects unfinished. I was
					tempted to just do it in Python, but we'll ignore that temptation. A better
					temptation will be, after it's done, to do it as a web app and make it
					a graphically viable game, even if it retains it's simplicity.</p>

        <p>Alright, that's a lot. Till next week!</p>

      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>27-03-22</small>
        <p>Well, I definitely didn't do any more of the job hunting that I should
					have done, but that's fine. This week turned into focussing on finishing
					off the part time job that ended on Friday.</p>

        <p>Apart from that stuff though, I managed to finish the Trivia website,
					as well as the home page and I watched the Flask lecture. I'd like to come
					back to the website though a bit and work some more on the javascript. I
					wanted to spend more time on it, but I didn't really want to delay watching
					the next lecture and because I'm so close to the end now I just want to
					sprint.</p>

        <p>The website ended up being a homepage for Anne Boleyn, just for funsies
					and because it's easier to make stuff up for a historical figure. All the
					pages are down and organised so that they look good on both desktop and
					mobile, but I want to add more interactivity with javascript since that's
					the part that I'm weakest on.</p>

        <p>I watched the Flask lecture though which was very interesting and tied
					together a lot of loose ends that I myself have had over the years with
					web application development. My focus has always been websites and I've
					always managed to make do with mostly html/css and just stealing bits of
					javascript here and there to make certain things work.</p>

        <p>This coming week I've gained a lot of hours so I'm hoping to be able to
					split my time nicely between being able to start the Flask lab/problem and
					also give some time to my Anne website project and maybe even my C game
					which I havn't touched in several weeks.</p>

        <p>I also saved a few more examples of SQL murder mystery websites which
					inspired the SQL Fiftyville problem from a few weeks ago. I think that
					will be a fun thing to do when I have some time and also help reinforce
					any SQL commands.</p>

        <p>Till next week!</p>

      </div>
			<div class="text_container">
				<small>21-03-22</small>
				<p>Hah. Overly ambitious I thought. Smashed it.</p>

				<p>Firstly, the SQL/databases lecture was very interesting and I found the
					syntax and the concepts very easy to to grasp. I found myself being able
					to wizz through the labs and the problems, which were set out very nicely
					by giving you a bunch of increasingly specific and complex queries to search
					through.</p>

				<p>Then the final problem was "Fiftyville", which was set out as a murder
					mystery where you were given a relational database worth of clues to solves.
					There must have been about 10 tables in there with relational information
					and you had to make a not of all of your queries whilst you worked things
					out one clue at a time. Definitely the most fun I've had with any of the
					roblems and it was very satisfying to complete.</p>

				<p>This happened around the middle of the week which allowed me to also watch
					the next lecture which was about HTML/CSS/Javascript. Good lecture even
					if I felt a little bored during the parts that I felt I already knew. It's
					always good to have things explained to you from a slightly different perspective
					or in a different way though, and they always do a good job of presenting
					and keeping things interesting.</p>

				<p>The javascript kept me busy though and I'm glad to say the initial lab
					was mostly about the javascript, or atl east that's how it seemed to me.
					So I managed to complete that before the end of the week and now I'm on
					the build a homepage part. I'm quite looking forward to it, as it's been
					a while since I worked on a website and also I'm going to try and make it
					interactive and challenging, and also make sure that I'm using good html/css
					practices that I may not have been aware of before.</p>

				<p>So, last week was smashed and this week I'd like to get this website done
					by the endo of Tuesday at the latest giving me time to watch the next lecture
					which is "Flask", which I think is a framework...</p>

				<p>I should have done more on the jobhunting, profile building side of things
					by now. This is the beginning of my last week of part time employment, and
					I thought I'd be much further ahead than where I am. I am going to complete
					some of these things before the end of the week but also being so close to
					the end of the course has made me really want to concentrate on this and
					get it done and out of the way so I can start TOP.</p>

				<p>Perhaps next week's post will be more about that side of things. Until then.</p>
			</div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>13-03-22</small>
        <p>Illness definitely gone and this has been a good productive week. We finished
          off the dna.py program on Thursday but it did feel slightly hacky. I started
          watching the next lecture which is on databases/sql and there were a few
          examples that gave me clues/ideas on how else I could have solved the
          problem.</p>

        <p>I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, because the problem was solved
          and it went through the check50 program that CS50 put together and passed
          with flying colours, but it just made me stop to think about how in the
          future when I feel like I have the time to do so I can reread some code
          and perhaps try and think of there's a better to way to have done things.
          From some of the posts you see come up on reddit from professionals though,
          it seems like this is not uncommon and that perhaps having the time to
          clean up code is something a lot of developers wish they had more time
          for.</p>

        <p>Anyway, we're on databases and we've managed to watch 2/3rds of the lecture
          before the end of the week with good notes. It reminded me that I did actually
          play with SQL once before, but just in a casual way and not for very long.
          I just recognised some of the commands and the format of input. Either way,
          I have a feeling this will be a somewhat easier week with the 2 problems
          that I skim read, and after that is html/css/javascript week, which I am
          hoping will be a breeze for me.</p>

        <p>After that it's just 2 weeks of lectures left and they seem to be a bit
          more concept/ethics focussed so perhaps it's just building up to whatever
          the final project is going to be. Either way I feel excited and focussed
          and ready to get there so I can finish this course off and start focussing
          more on website design properly.</p>

        <p>The probably overly ambitious goal for this week then is to finish off
          the lecture as well as complete both problems, and then watch the next
          weeks lecture. Here goes.</p>
        </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>06-03-22</small>
        <p>Well, this week has been something of a writeoff.. the cold/flu that I thought
          I was all but over last week seems to have come since Monday. I've been in bed
          for 2-3 days this week watching a hell of a lot of Netflix/TV. Next week..
          bigger, better, more things.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>27-02-22</small>
        <p>It's been a good/fun week! Managed to get through all but 1 of the Python
          challenges, and the last one was just finished yesterday (Saturday). The
          last one I've only really glanced at but I suspect is going to be the long/hard
          one, which is fine. They've all been copies of old C programs that I've written
          until now really, apart from the lab so a bit more of a challenge will be
          welcome.. though if I'm still working on it in the next journal I'll be less
          than impressed.</p>

        <p>I also worked some on my 'game' which is what's in yoru pack? I don't actually
          remember if I mentioned this in the journal or if I was keeping it secret,
          but either way I don't care anymore. It's just a program that lists items
          in a pack at random and then allows the user to add more items or relist
          them. It only quits when promted, which is different for any program I've
          written so far in C, (or anything else).</p>

        <p>It's been interesting going back to C after spending so many days on python.
          The difference is definitely noticeable, but I still think it's worth the
          time and effort sticking with C and eventually probably C++ now and again
          as it's meant to be so difficult.</p>

        <p>This week is also get a job week. I'm going to be redoing my LinkedIN,
          signing up to Upwork to see what that's all about and just generally looking
          for what's out there. I also wanna make sure the github is all cleaned up
          and presentable and then we'll see how far behind I am for getting an entry
          level webdev job!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>20-02-22</small>
        <p>Missed a week, BUT we've managed to get through the speller problem and
          also finish off the next week's lecture in that time which is nice. It was
          the intro to Python, which has been very interesting and raised a few ideas
          of how I can change up the Adventurer's pack program. It also gave me the
          idea that it would definitely be nice to have a few of these projects on
          the go and that perhaps the best way to keep a track of these but also link
          them to this, is to have a separate little list of projects to the side on
          this journal site that I can then also link to my github for anyone who
          might be interested.</p>

        <p>Python does seem a lot more powerful, but after doing some reading I do
          definitely see some benefits to keeping up with the C and then eventually
          maybe C++ programming. Learning the harder way to make the more powerful
          programs even easier seems like a smart move in the long run. We'll see how
          that one goes..</p>

        <p>The Python problems seem a lot smaller, but there are 6 of them to tackle
          so it's hard to tell if this is going to really take me a long time or not.
          We'll also have to see about that. Since it's mostly concepts that make sense
          in C I'm hoping that it won't be too bad and I'll be able to work things
          out quite quickly. I've also seen ahead and the next lecture will be on SQL,
          which will be very interesting I think. And very useful for when I tackle
          the ODIN project I would have thought.</p>

        <p>Also looking ahead on the calendar and have confirmed the last date of
          my current contract which is the 25th March. This means that I should really
          start looking for the next step at the end of this coming week and seeing
          what's out there and how far behind I might be to get myself in the door.</p>

        <p>Exciting... terrifying?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>06-02-22</small>
        <p>This week has been focussing on CS50 of course. Finishing off the lecture
          for Week 5 and then hitting the problem, Speller. It's been interesting
          seeing how linked lists really can function properly as well as learning
          about Hash tables. Still working things out, but I've also had a fun idea
          for a side project to help me grasp this, which is to create a little program
          of an adventurer and what's in his pack. Adding items to the pack dynamically
          and perhaps taking user input to make all sorts of things appear in the
          bag and then make the program spit out the results whenever prompted.</p>

        <p>Was considering starting up the ODIN stuff again, but really I want to
          concentrate fully on finishing this now so that I can then concentrate on
          more web dev stuff fully as well, rather than do half and half of both.
          I'll still I think keep trying to think up these little side programs to
          write in C and maybe other languages later on to keep up those skills and
          build on them alongside html/css.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>30-01-22</small>
        <p>Well, we did not get quite as far as we'd hope, but that's fine. It is
          what it is. We spent a few days going over our notes and also going over
          the notes in the lecture writeup and comparing and adjusting. Definitely
          happy with that side of things, and it made me feel more ready to take on
          the lab challenge. I did not, however, get to complete it. To be fair to
          myself, I did not have the full 3 sessions/days to work at it, as there
          was quite a lot of other stuff going on. We'll definitely do it this
          week.</p>

        <p>We did, though, finish the last days of the Linux skillupchallenge which
          was great to do. It really felt useful right up until the end, and I'd like
          to think that this week I'll continue to go back into the webserver and
          plan what to do with it properly, whilst also researching the prices of
          the service that I picked. Perhaps I could even take a look at AWS and
          whatever else is recommended by the course to see if there is a better
          one. As long as it's not crazy expensive, I think I'd like to move my two
          websites over to that. That'll be one move off the provided service and
          then hopefully as I delve deeper into the js/php side of things after CS50,
          I'll be able to move off of Shopify also.</p>

        <p>This week though, is focusing back on the CS50 lab and then the problem
          so that at the very least I am ready to be moving onto Lecture6 at the
          beginning of next week.</p>
      </div>

          <p>So another week gone by, and we've finished watching the lecture for
            Week 5 on CS50, which was surrounding data structures and different ways
            to create "linked lists". It was very interesting and I definitely made
            a bigger effort on the note taking which I'm hoping will pay off. We're
            going to go in hard this week on finishing the problems. There's only
            1 lab and 1 problem this time, so hopefully it won't take too long to
            do. I'm also going to re go over the notes and make them better, re-reading
            if necessary the notes on the website.</p>

          <p>This week has also been 5 more days of the Linux skill up challenge,
            which has been great to get back into. Introducing some things I already
            knew, but giving more depth to them. The resources given are all really
            interesting, and I think it'd be good even, later in the year to do
            it again and see what new resources are added and also see which things
            I use more myself and how I can commit some of those commands to memory.
            In general, since I've been using a lot of Linux, I think a lot of it
            has come back to me already.</p>

          <p>We've still not touched back in with ODIN, but perhaps when I've finished
            Januarys skill up challange with Linux, it'd be a good thing to get back
            into. Perhaps with a focus on using my webserver for my own purposes
            and seeing what I can do to host my websites myself rather than rely
            on one.com.</p>

          <p>We'll see about that though. This coming week is focusing on more Linux
            learning and finishing off Week 5, whilst also hopefully getting into
            the Week 6 lecture. This has all taken a lot longer than I thought it
            would, but that's fine we're getting through it the best we can.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_container">
        <small>09-01-22</small>
        <p>Well, it's the new year! Time flew by it seems and I'm already at the
          end of the first week of 2022. This week I decided to jump into the Linux
          Skill Up Challenge over on reddit,
          (https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/). Saw this around the
          end of November and decided that December wasn't the month to start it,
          but January would be. It's been really good so far, I've set up a remot
          webserver with Digital Ocean for 5$ and gone through the first week of
          very basic learning of commands. It's all rehashing of things I already
          feel pretty comfortable with, but there were a few good tips in there,
          so I'm enjoying having that to do in the evenings, alongside some maths
          and typing practice.</p>

       <p>I've also jumped back into CS50, feeling better about the things that I
         wasn't so sure about at the end of last year. Finished off lesson 4 and we're
         going to be going into lesson 5 later today. Something I was thinking about
         a lot last week is that I spent a lot of time during lesson 4 going back
         over things way too many times, and I think that's partly because I've been
         getting worse at note taking as the weeks have gone by during the first
         watch of the lecture.</p>

       <p>So this week I'm going to be taking more time on the video, pausing it as
         necessary to make the best possible notes. This way I think I'll get more
         comfortabel with the material and probably have to spend less time working
         things out when I'm doing the problems.</p>

       <p>Something else I've been thinking about lately is what to do when I finish
         CS50. I am going to be doing the ODIN project more of course, and concentrating
         on javascript. But I thought it'd be a fun project to go back to the CS50
         problems and solve them using javascript. Then also creating some webpages
         to present the solutions in a website. They are ready made problems after
         all, and this would let me flex the html/css as well as have something to
         play with using javascript. We'll see how that one goes..</p>

       <p>Anyway, that's that for now! Hopefull should be talking about how I completed
         Lesson 5 in the next one!</p>

        <p>Alright! It's the holiday season coming up so we're mostly going to be
          taking a break from all of this. I think I'l be very tempted to keep looking
          at it here and there and I'm certainly not going to be stopping myself,
          but we're also not going to pressure ourselves into feeling like we need
          to do that.</p>
        <p>I've got those two books that I could read also, as a half leisure, half
          learning thing to be doing. It'll be helpful without straining too much
          over the holiday break. I think I'll aim to do the next one of these on
          the 9th Jan. I could do the 2nd but I won't really have anything to talk
          about studywise, so till Next Year!</p>

      <div class="text_container">

        <p>Holy Crapola. I don't actually say that. I finished the problem from before
          and it took way longer than it should have. Though I a quite glad that it's
          done and I've moved onto the "recover" problem. This one is more about
          file manipulation with some conditional statments there in to manipulate
          data and create files... easy. Right?</p>
        <p>I've also actually started watching the video for the next week which has
          been good to do. It's felt good just to start watching and taking the notes
          nd feels a bit more like we're back on track with how things are meant to
          be going. Apart from that Xmas is coming up, so I am thinking about when
          to take the break.. Will think on that a bit more before making a decision.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>21-11-21</small>
        <p>Another week has gone by, and this one I did make some actualy progress
          with Week 6, Lecture 5.</p>
        <p>The difficulty has been of pointers and the associated lab problem. It's
          been tricky to get my head around, but I'm definitely also been procrastinating,
          probably because I was finding things a bit difficult. The problem was to take a
          BMP file and create a little program that can either make a new image from
          the original, but greyscale, another that creates a sepia image, another
          that creates a mirror image, and finally one that blurs the image.</p>
        <p>This last week I managed to create the part of the program that turns the
          image grey and sepia, and now I'm thinking about the mirrored image. Essentially
          it's about going through each pixel one at a time and then reversing each
          row of them. The first two problems did not actually require pointers at
          all, which threw me. I figured I'd definitely need to be using them, but
          when I solved it and realised they didn't actually need them at all, I
          had to look at it differently.</p>
        <p>Mirroring will require pointers. I've been reading/watching the notes and
          lectures again though to make sure I get it..</p>
        <p>This coming week I really need to have finished that problem and there's
          still one more from this lecture after. My goal of finishing this course
          before xmas seems unlikely now, but we'll see how the lectures after go.
          I might speed through a few of them if this is meant to be the hardest
          concept to grasp? We'll see.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
          <small>14-11-21</small>
          <p>Another week has gone by and this time I've made no progress on CS50,
            nor really on TOP. I did some flexbox work and I read over some of the notes
            from the CS50 one, but I really hit a wall on that. One which I intend
            to smash through this coming week.</p>

         <p>I did, however, get back into the regular Maths studying. I've also noticed
            a real different from doing the daily typing tests on keybr. It's been a
            little over a month now of regular practice and I can feel the speed is
            up and my accuracy on punctuation is better than before. Speed on the
            letters/numbers is harder to tell but probably also better.</p>

         <p>Not really learning/coding related, but I've reconfigured my Ubuntu VM to
            work with the i3 window manager and configured that to my liking. Works
            nicely with the two monitors and feels good for studying. Definitely feels
            good to have a separate environment for this side of things against everything
            else.</p>

         <p>This coming week, smashing through CS50, as well as the HTML side of TOP.
           Once I get through the wall happening with pointers the rest should come easy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="text_container">
        <small>8-11-21</small>
        <p>This last week has been a bit of a blur. I worked on the module that deals
          with file pointers and such, and I really find it quite confusing. I think
          I can grasp all of the concepts separately, but then working with them,
          I get lost quite easily. As mentioned before though, this is apparently the
          most difficult concept to grasp, so I'm giving myself time to absorb and
          doing the problems to help and I'll probably see what other reading I can
          do on the subject that will help. Always helps to hear things explained
          in more than one way.</p>

        <p>Apart from that I recaught up with TOP so I can work my way through something
          a bit easier but also remind myself of some things.. That was fine.</p>

        <p>Not much else to tell apart from that! These coming weeks I have a lot less
          planned socially, so I'm going to really try and get my head down and focus
          on studying.</p>

        <p>Till next week.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>31-10-21</small>
        <p>Alrighty, I managed to miss last week's entry, that's not so good is it.
          Anyway, onto this week, it was really a week of being back properly and not
          having to catch up with things, so I got through a fair chunk of CS50.
          Finished off Weed 3 (0 indexed) and started Week 4. Week 4 introduced the
          idea of pointers and file manipulation, which made some past things click
          and reveals the use of some training wheels with regards to string manipulation.</p>
       <p>I found it quite complicated and difficult actually, but David whatshisface in the
          videos says that's likely to be so, so I wasn't overly worried about it. I watched the
          extra videos as well, which do add up altogether but it felt worth it this week.
          I managed to complete the lab where you edit the sound volume of a wav file,
          which was mostly given to you but still good.</p>

       <p>I havn't worked at all on TOP these last few weeks as I've been concentrating
          so much on Inktober as well as studying. Today is the end of the month so that's
          all finished now which feels great. Also it means I can concentrate more
          on studying again, and putting some time into TOP and also putting a bit
          of extra time in the maths side of the Khan Academy, because that's been a
          bit neglected this month also.</p>

       <p>This coming week I'd like to finish the Labs for Week 4, and get a start on
          Week 5 of CS50. I've noticed that there are new recordings going up from this
          year which is interesting.. I might take a look at some of them, or at least
          the notes after I've finished CS50 2020, to see if there are any differences.
          I'm also going to concentrate as mentioned above on TOP, and hopefully get
          myself past the HTML/CSS stuff, (though I don't want to rush them in case they
          have useful tidbits I don't already know) and get to the javascript and beyond
          sections.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="text_container">
        <small>17-10-21</small>
        <p>This week I have been sick as a dog... started last Sunday night and for
          most of the week I have been completely useless to the world. I did a little
          reading from the Pragmatic Programmer, but really not enough to be noteworthy
          and that's the extent of my progress this week.</p>

        <p>But that's fine. Feeling a lot better tonight and tomorrow we begin again
          properly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>10-10-21</small>
        <p>Another week down
        </p>
        <p>This week was mainly concentrating on working up the Odin Project stuff
          as well as prettying the website for the Inktober stuff. Got that down well,
          and happy with it for something nice and simple. The Flexbox stuff made it
          easy for the site to work well on desktop & mobile without having to create
          a separate site like with my regular works, which is nice.
        </p>
        <p>I also made a bit more progress with CS50, though less so than other weeks.
          I had to finish off last week's Problems/Labs, and then only watched this weeks
          lecture on Thursday/Friday. It was mainly focussed on sorting algorithms,
          so there wasn't too much more code added to it. I'll have to try and tackle
          the problems from tomorrow and we'll see how that goes for the rest of
          the week.
        </p>
        <p>Part time job plodded along easily this week, and hopefully that will be
          the same from now on. It'll just happen for 3 hours a day and that'll be
          that.
        </p>
        <p>Less programming/study related but a lot of my time after the job was dedicated
          to inktober as it will be this coming week. Enjoying doing that again but
          I'm also kind of looking forward to doing a bit less of it come November,
          and maybe not feeling like I have to keep catching myself up for anything
          missed.
        </p>
        <p>Next week going to focus on CS50, and more of the Odin Project. I did start
          reading the Pragmatic Programmer a few weeks ago, and that's something else
          I've let slip so I'd like to pick that up again more heavily.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>03-10-21</small>
        <p>Did more of the same this week study wise. Moved onto the third lecture on
           CS50, and that went alright. A bit trickier, but still feeling good to get
           through the lecture and test out the various concepts that we learn on the
           given problems. Don't think there was anything in particular that stood out,
           just more C.
        </p>
        <p>I also tried pushing through the Odin Project stuff some more and made quite
           a dent in that. Have moved passed all the initial stages as well as the initial
           delving into HTML, and I think I'm at the CSS parts now. There was a whole
           page on flexbox which was good to try out since I never really played with
           that before properly.
        </p>
        <p>I also made a separate site using the flexbox stuff for the inktober posts that
           I'm going to be doing. Though I did run out of time these last few days on
           finishing that off properly, so I need to do that. I want to add a story page
           for each piece and I don't want to have to make a secondary site so that things
           look good on mobile. I want it to really work across both. I'll finish that
           off tomorrow.
        </p>
        <p>This week I started both the part time job as well as Inktober. Both are going
           to take a fair bit of time on a regular basis, but I think it'll be good to
           help me get back into regular art making.
        </p>
        <p>I do feel like I was more distracted this week away from studying than last
           week, but I have nothing extra coming up this week until the weekend so I
           should be able to get back into the higher gear. I'd like to be able to
           finish off the inktober website, complete another lecture on CS50, and make
           a further dent on the Odin Project.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text_container">
        <small>26-09-21</small>
        <p>Week one, completed. It's felt great.</p>
        <p>But anyway, I've started with the CS50 course that Harvard offer for free,
           (as long as you don't buy into the certificate); as well as pushing through
           with the Odin Project foundation. CS50 has started me off with C as well
           as general Computer Science, and the Odin project is HTML/CSS focussed
           so far. The C stuff is interesting, kinda like javascript on the outset,
           but the end of lecture challenges have been really good and interesting.
           I managed okay with the first few but one of them really stumped me and I
           ended up googling the answer. I was a bit bummed, but after seeing the answer
           I definitely made the right choice.. I was not going to guess my way into
           that this early on. There are 9 "weeks" left on the CS50, but I know that
           some of them cover areas of computer science that I already know pretty
           well so I will be aiming to finish that off quicker. Either way it'll be
           done before the end of the year.
        </p>
        <p>The Odin Project so far is just covering areas I already know, but it's
           still been useful since I never really learned this stuff properly. I only
           ever covered the networking side of the CIW course I did many years ago,
           pretty much everything I know about html/css was self taught, so there are
           gaps. Also there are things that weren't around back then like flexbox, and
           although I know what it is and how it works it's still useful to get to
           grips with it and practice it. I'll get though the html/css quickly and
           then it moves onto javascript which will be the more interesting part.
        </p>
        <p>Something else I've picked up again this week was going through some maths
           courses on Khan Academy. I started doing this a few months ago but dropped
           it because I aimed too low.. It's good practice though. I've gone through
           a bunch of arithmetic practice and now doing fractions/decimals. It's all
           coming back nice and easy, it's just good I think to get used to dealing
           with numbers often again. It'll definitely help with the javascript/C stuff.
        </p>
        <p>The other thing I've been getting into the daily habit of doing is practicing
           getting my typing speed up and stable on some typing test site. It's been a
           good thing to do first thing in the morning before I get going.
        </p>
        <p>This coming week will be more of the same, but I also want to be starting to
           spend time buildin up a separate project and the first one I want to work on
           is this site. At the moment I'm hard coding these weekly entries, and I'd like
           to build something where I can login and put in an entry, and maybe add
           some more features along the way as I pick things up.
        </p>
        <p>Part time job starts tomorrow, 1-4. Means 3 hours less time to study but
           also means not burning through savings for the next 6 months as long as I
           remain sensible... we'll see how that one goes.

      <div class="text_container">
        <small>19-09-21</small>
        <p>Alright, first entry. Technically I’m starting this journey from tomorrow,
           so this weekend has been more about mentally preparing, as well as making
           sure physical space is clean and food is prepped so that tomorrow can be
           full focus.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve got a few ideas in mind about where to start, and I’m not exactly
           sure how it’s going to go. I think that I’m going to explore a bit the
           various resources and then make a timetable as the day goes on to map
           out how much time different things get. I’ve used the ODIN project before,
           and I’m currently signed up to the Harvard CS50 course. I’ve done the first
           lesson of it and it’s pretty decent, but I don’t want to sit around watching
           videos all week, so I’ll probably do some of that as well as play with

        <p>I’m doing all of this on an ElementaryOS flavoured VM that I’ve set up
           purely for this purpose. Nothing wrong with Windows for me, but it made
           sense to set something Linux based up so that I can practice using it
           again.
        </p>
        <p>Main goals for this week then are to get going, have some idea about
           which resources to focus on at first, and maybe even have a rough timetable
           in mind for the days. Also to spend the week using Linux, and make sure
           that I’m not just reading/watching things, but also trying to build something,
           even if it’s simple.
